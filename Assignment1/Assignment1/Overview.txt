The chosen design for the HTML and CSS structure follows a clean and modern approach, making use of a sans-serif font, specifically 'Arial', for the entire document. This choice provides a contemporary and widely accessible typographic style. The elimination of default margins and padding in the body ensures a consistent starting point for styling, contributing to a more controlled layout.

In the header section, a dark background color (#333) is paired with white text to create a visually striking contrast. The centralized alignment of text within the header, along with 20 pixels of padding, ensures a balanced and visually appealing presentation. This design decision aims to make the header stand out as a focal point, drawing attention to the main message.

For the gallery section, the use of Flexbox with properties such as display: flex, flex-wrap: wrap, and justify-content: space-around facilitates the creation of a responsive grid layout. This layout adapts to different screen sizes, and the padding around the gallery section enhances spacing and overall aesthetics.

Individual photos within the gallery are given padding and a maximum width of 90%. The border-radius property adds a subtle rounded corner effect to the images. Furthermore, a specific adjustment is made for Picture 2, setting its maximum width to 40%, creating a medium-sized appearance compared to the default size.

The footer shares a similar design philosophy with the header, featuring a dark background color, white text, and centralized alignment. The 20 pixels of padding contribute to a consistent spacing pattern seen throughout the document.

The call-to-action button is styled as an inline block with defined padding, text decoration, background color (#ff6600), and text color (#fff). On hover, the background color smoothly transitions to a slightly darker shade, enhancing the interactive feel of the button.

Heading styles (h1 and h2) are customized for various sections of the document. Design choices include color adjustments, font-size modifications, and margin settings to maintain a cohesive and visually pleasing appearance across different headings.

In summary, the design choices focus on creating a visually appealing, balanced, and responsive photography portfolio with a modern aesthetic. These decisions aim to enhance readability, draw attention to key elements, and provide a cohesive visual experience for the viewer.
